### **PROFESSIONAL PROFILE**
A Health Sciences graduate and **Native English speaker** with 7 years of residency in Germany. Following the completion of my degree in Community and Health Psychology, I specialized in early childhood education, managing large groups and curriculum development. After a rewarding two-year period dedicated to raising my daughter, I am now re-entering the workforce. I am seeking a stable, purposeful, non-customer-facing role where I can apply my experience in planning, organization, and high-level responsibility to support a professional team.
